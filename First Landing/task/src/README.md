##Stage 1/6: Layout
###Description

Before starting directly to build the project always try to build a basic schema in your head about how your project will look and what it will comprise or you can also use some drawing tools that are available on the internet.

For this project, let's start with the basic layout of our landing page. At first, the whole webpage or let's say the landing page is divided into 3 parts: Header, Main, and Footer. You need to divide the HTML body into these three parts. The header tag contains the navbar of the landing page, the main tag contains the main content of the landing page, and the footer tag contains the footer of the landing page.

Now, let's set the height of our body and then the height of the sections i.e. header, main, and footer of our landing page. You have to set the maximum height of the body to 100% of the viewable screen's height. Make sure to use the vh unit while setting the height of the body.

Select the header, main, and footer and set their minimum height to 10%, 60% and 30% of the viewable screen's height. Here also, you need to use the vh unit to set their sizes.

Because the viewport height of the devices may not be the same so we cannot use the absolute units therefore prefer to use the vh unit in this project.
###Objectives

In this stage, you should have created the following in your first landing webpage:

* Divide the webpage into three parts i.e. Header, Main, and Footer and the order of the division should be the same as mentioned here.
* The maximum height of the body tag and the minimum height of the header, main and footer tag should be set as per the above-mentioned rules.
