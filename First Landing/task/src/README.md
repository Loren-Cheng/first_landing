# Stage 1/6: Layout
### Description

Now, let's set the height of our body and then the height of the sections i.e. header, main, and footer of our landing page. You have to set the maximum height of the body to 100% of the viewable screen's height. Make sure to use the vh unit while setting the height of the body.

Select the header, main, and footer and set their minimum height to 10%, 60% and 30% of the viewable screen's height. Here also, you need to use the vh unit to set their sizes.

Because the viewport height of the devices may not be the same so we cannot use the absolute units therefore prefer to use the vh unit in this project.
### Objectives

In this stage, you should have created the following in your first landing webpage:

* Divide the webpage into three parts i.e. Header, Main, and Footer and the order of the division should be the same as mentioned here.
* The maximum height of the body tag and the minimum height of the header, main and footer tag should be set as per the above-mentioned rules.
